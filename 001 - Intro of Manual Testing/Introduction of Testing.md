## What is Software Testing? ##

The process of Software Testing is not only at finding faults in the existing software but also at finding measures to improve the software in terms of efficiency, accuracy and usability. It mainly aims at measuring the specification, functionality and performance of a software program or application.

## Software Testing can be broadly classified into two types: ##

**Manual Testing**:

- Manual testing includes testing software manually, i.e., without using any automation tool or any script. In this type, tester takes over the role of an end-user and tests the software to identify any unexpected behaviour or bug. There are difference stages of manual testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing.
- Testers use test plans, test cases & test scenarios to test software to ensure the completeness of testing. Manual Testing also includes exploratory testing, as testers explore the software to identify errors in it.      

**Automation Testing**:

- Automation testing, which is also known as Test Automation, is when the tester writes scripts and uses another software to test the product. This process involves the automation of a manual process. Automation testing is uses to re-run the test scenarios quickly and repeatedly, that were performed manually in manual testing.
- Apart  from regression testing, automation testing is also used to test the application from a load, performance and stress point of view. It increases the test coverage, improves accuracy and saves time and money when compared to manual testing.

## Prerequisite to learn Software Testing: ## 

Before learning software testing, you should have basic knowledge of basic computer functionality, basic mathematics, computer language, and logical operators.
