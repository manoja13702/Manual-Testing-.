## JIRA: ##

Jira is a popular project management and issue tracking tool developed by Atlassian. It's widely used for managing software development projects and teams, offering various features to support agile methodologies like Scrum.

## SCRUM: ##

Scrum is an agile framework for managing complex knowledge work, commonly used in software development. It emphasizes iterative and incremental progress, flexibility, and collaboration among team members.

- **Creating Epic:**

An epic in Jira represents a large user story or a significant piece of work that cannot be completed within a single iteration. Epics are used to group related user stories together and provide a higher-level view of the project's scope.

- **User Stories:**

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality from the user's perspective. They capture what a user needs to accomplish using the software. User stories are the building blocks of a project's requirements and are used to define the work that needs to be done.

- **Sprint Planning:**

Sprint planning is a Scrum ceremony where the development team selects a set of user stories or tasks from the product backlog to be worked on during the upcoming sprint. The team estimates the effort required for each item and commits to completing them within the sprint's time frame.

- **Backlog:**

The backlog is a prioritized list of all the work items, such as user stories, features, and bugs, that need to be addressed in a project. The product backlog represents the overall scope of the project, and the sprint backlog contains the specific items planned for the current sprint.

- **Severity and Priority:**

Severity and priority are attributes used to classify and prioritize issues or tasks in Jira. Severity indicates the impact of an issue on the functionality or user experience, while priority determines how urgently the issue needs to be addressed.

- **Release Version:**

A release version in Jira represents a specific version or iteration of the software that is ready for deployment or delivery to users. It's a way to track and manage different stages of the product's development and release cycle.
