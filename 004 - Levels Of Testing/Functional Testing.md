- **Unit Testing:**
 
i) Unit testing involves the testing of each unit or an individual component of the software application. It is the first level of functional testing. The aim behind unit testing is to validate unit components with its performance.

ii) A unit is a single testable part of a software system and tested during the development phase of the application software. White box testing approach used for unit testing and usually done by the developers.

- **Integration Testing:**
  
i) Integration testing is the second level of the software testing process comes after unit testing. In this testing, units or individual components of the software are tested in a group. The focus of the integration testing level is to expose defects at the time of interaction between integrated components or units.

ii) Unit Testing  uses modules for testing purpose, and these modules are combined and tested in integration testing. The Software is developed with a number of software modules that are coded by different coders or programmers. The goal of integration testing is to check the correctness of communication among all the modules.

- **System Testing:**

i) System Testing includes testing of a fully integrated software system. Generally, a computer system is made with the integration of software (any software is only a single element of a computer system). The software is developed in units and then interfaced with other software and hardware to create a complete computer system. In other words, a computer system consists of a group of software to perform the various tasks, but only software cannot perform the task; for that software must be interfaced with compatible hardware. System testing is a series of different type of tests with the purpose to exercise and examine the full working of an integrated software computer system against requirements.

ii) To check the end-to-end flow of an application or the software as a user is known as **System testing**. In this, we navigate (go through) all the necessary modules of an application and check if the end features or the end business works fine, and test the product as a whole system.

iii) It is **end-to-end testing** where the testing environment is similar to the production environment.


- **User Acceptance Testing:**
  
i) User acceptance testing (UAT) is a type of testing, which is done by the customer before accepting the final product. Generally, UAT is done by the customer (domain expert) for their satisfaction, and check whether the application is working according to given business scenarios, real-time scenarios.

ii) In this, we concentrate only on those features and scenarios which are regularly used by the customer or mostly user scenarios for the business or those scenarios which are used daily by the end-user or the customer.

- **Smoke Testing:**
  
i) Smoke Testing comes into the picture at the time of receiving build software from the development team. The purpose of smoke testing is to determine whether the build software is testable or not. " This process is also known as "Day 0".

ii) It is a time-saving process. It reduces testing time because testing is done only when the key features of the application are not working or if the key bugs are not fixed. The focus of Smoke Testing is on the workflow of the core and primary functions of the application.

iii) Testing the basic & critical feature of an application before doing one round of deep, rigorous testing (before checking all possible positive and negative values) is known as smoke testing.

- **Regression Testing:**
  
i) Regression testing is a black box testing techniques. It is used to check that a code change in the software does not impact the existing functionality of the product. Regression testing is making sure that the product works fine with new functionality, bug fixes, or any change in the existing feature.

ii)  Regression means Re-test those parts of the application, which are unchanged.

- **Sanity Testing:**
  
i) Sanity testing was performed when we are receiving software build (with minor code changes) from the development team. It is a checkpoint to assess if testing for the build can proceed or not.

ii) In other words, we can say that sanity testing is performed to make sure that all the defects have been solved and no added issues come into the presence because of these modifications.

iii) Sanity testing also ensures that the modification in the code or functions does not affect the associated modules. Consequently, it can be applied only on connected modules that can be impacted.

- **Retesting:**

Retesting occurs after a defect has been fixed; It is designed to check whether the defects have been fixed. Retesting is typically performed by the same testers who identified the defect for the first time.
