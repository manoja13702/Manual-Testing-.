1) **Test Execution:**

`                    `Test execution is the phase where test cases are executed using the defined test data in the test environment. It involves running tests, comparing actual results with expected outcomes, and identifying discrepancies.

1) **Execute Test Cases:**
**
`             `Executing test cases is the process of following the steps outlined in the test cases and recording the results. This determines whether the software functions as intended.

1) **Defect Tracking and Reporting:**
**
`                         `Defect tracking involves identifying, documenting, and managing issues or defects discovered during testing. Defect reporting involves creating detailed reports about the defects found, including their impact and severity.

1) **Types of Bugs:**

`                                  `Bugs can be categorized into various types, such as functional, performance, usability, security, and compatibility bugs, each representing different aspects of software issues.

1) **Identifying the bugs:**

`                                  `Identifying bugs involves observing discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes during test execution. It requires keen attention to detail and a comprehensive understanding of the software's behaviour.

1) **Bug/Defect Life Cycle:**

`                                  `The bug or defect life cycle describes the stages that a reported defect goes through, from discovery to resolution. It typically includes stages like new, open, assigned, fixed, verified, and closed.

1) **Reporting the Bugs:**

`                                             `Reporting bugs involves documenting the defects discovered during testing. A well-detailed bug report includes information about the defect's location, steps to reproduce, and the expected and actual results.

1) **Severity and Priority:**

`                                             `Severity refers to the impact of a bug on the system's functionality or user experience. Priority indicates the urgency with which a bug needs to be fixed. Both factors help prioritize bug fixing efforts.
