## Test Planning: ##

The test planning object defines what aspect of the software or system the test plan will cover. It specifies the scope and boundaries of testing efforts.

- **Scope of Testing:**

The scope of testing outlines what features, functionalities, or components will be tested and what won't be tested. It helps set clear expectations and ensures comprehensive coverage.

- **Schedule:**

The schedule in a test plan includes timelines for different testing phases, milestones, and deadlines, ensuring efficient time management throughout the testing process.

- **Approach:**

The approach in a test plan outlines the testing strategies, methodologies, and techniques that will be used to ensure the quality and reliability of the software.

- **Roles & Responsibilities:**

Roles and responsibilities define who is responsible for each testing activity and what their specific roles are, ensuring clear accountability within the testing team.

- **Assumption:**

Assumptions are factors or conditions that are considered to be true for the purposes of the testing effort. They help contextualize the testing plan.

- **Risks & Mitigations:**

Risks are potential issues or challenges that could impact the testing process. Mitigations are the planned actions to minimize or address these risks if they arise.

- **Entry & Exit Criteria:**

Entry criteria specify the conditions that must be met before testing can begin. Exit criteria outline the conditions under which testing will be considered complete and the software is ready for release.]

- **Test Automation:**

Test automation involves using tools and scripts to automate the execution of test cases. It helps improve efficiency, speed, and accuracy of testing processes.

- **Deliverables:** 

Deliverables in a test plan are the documents, reports, and artifacts that will be produced as a result of the testing effort. They could include test scripts, test reports, and documentation
