- **Decision Table Technique:**

In Decision table technique, we deal with combinations of inputs. 

To identify the test cases with decision table, we consider conditions and actions.           

We take conditions as inputs and actions as outputs. 

**Example:** Login validation - Allow user to login only when both the username and password is correct. 

Conditions 1: Enter valid username and valid password and Click Login. o Actions 1: Display home page and Execute. 

Conditions 2: Enter invalid username and valid password and Click Login. o Actions 2: Display Error message as invalid username.
