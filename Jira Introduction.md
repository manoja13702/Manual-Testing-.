***Projects:*** It is used to manage the defects very effectively.
Issue: It is used to track and manage the defects/issues.

***Workflow:*** Processes the Issue/Defect life cycle. Suppose we have a business requirement, we create the technical design and from the technical design, we create the test cases. After creating the test cases, coding is done, and then testing is performed on the project. This design workflow is possible by using Jira.

***Search:*** Find with ease. Suppose we have done with a project at the beginning of the December and its version is 1.0. Now, we move to version 1.1 and completed at the end of December. What we are doing is that we are adding new versions. Through Jira, we can get to know that what happened in the earlier versions, how many defects occurred in the earlier projects and the learning we achieve from the earlier projects.

***Dashboards:*** Dashboard is a display which you see when you log in to the Jira. You can create multiple dashboards for multiple projects. You can create the personal dashboard and can add the gadgets in a dashboard so that you can keep track of the assignments and issues that you are working on.
